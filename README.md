# Fareez Aziz Resume Website

## Project 1: User Centric Frontend Development 

### Context
This website is designed to showcase the user's resume in the form of a website. It is designed to incorporate aspects of the user's education and work history to be able to get the recruiters' attention and contact.
It is meant to be able to show the user as more than just a worker but also a person whom the recruiters feel can assimilate in their corporate culture and someone they would one to have as a colleague.
It is to give a more holisitc view of the user's profile.

## UX

The design for this website had the soft skills and hard skills of the user in mind. It also takes into account from the recruiter's point of view of what they would like to see in a candidate.

1. As a job seeker, I would like to be able to show my character to potential recruiters so that they can contact me should they find that I may be suitable for their company.
2. As a job seeker, I would like to be able to showcase my skillsets and experiences so that I may be offered various roles for a job.
3. As a recruiter, I would like to hire a candidate that will fit into my company culture for the current vacancy.
4. As a recruiter, I would like to contact a candidate that is adaptable to the changing demands of the economy for an interview.



Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

    As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
